description: >-
  ICUBAM is an open-source project built to help provide real-time information 
  on intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability in French hospitals. Data is 
  directly obtained from doctors working inside ICU by sending them SMS with 
  a HTTP link to a form that they can fill in 15 seconds.  ICUBAM can be easily
  deployed for other locales.
